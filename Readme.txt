"AR Books" is an application of augmented reality which superimposes video and other interactive media onto the books.

In the modern era of information we need to have faster access to the info. Traditional books are bit time consuming, static and less interactive. So we augmented the media into the books with the help of marker. Eventually, the marker can be reduced to a very small size.

We can revolutionize education with the help of this software. We will be able to make learning fun and interactive. Along with education, the sofware has ability to make great impact on tourism, where the user will be able to know about the place in a better manner before visiting it.

Suppose, you're reading a magazine and just came across a recepie just point your camera at the article and done! You can see the video in your real view. If you're using an HUD then you just look at the book and interact with the video.

The application not only augments the video, but also reads the magazine for you! It recognizes the text in the image and reads it for you! Learning has never been so easy.

If you're reading a geography book, the related videos will be streamed on your book itself.

Further working on augmenting 3D objects into the user's view as the trditional 2D diagrams give less visualization of objects, which will come really handy in studying anatomy.

HIGHLIGHTS:
1. Super Easy: All we need to do is point the camera of your device at the article in the book, it will then recognize the article and play the video in the users real view, without distracting the user from his target.

2.We used openCV and python to implement augmentation of media into the books.

3.The software is portable to all the available platforms.
